# Tempo Development Principles

## Core Values

1. **No shortcuts, workarounds, or quickfixes** — Every implementation must be architecturally correct
2. **Solid foundations first** — Get the core right before adding features
3. **Elegant and coherent** — Code should be readable, maintainable, and beautiful
4. **Production-ready only** — No stubs, no placeholders, no "we'll fix it later"

## Code Quality

- Every feature should be complete and polished
- UI must be visually stunning and feel premium
- Performance is non-negotiable (60fps, <100ms interactions)
- Accessibility matters (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

## When Implementing Features

1. **Plan properly** — Create an implementation plan, get approval
2. **Build correctly** — No temporary hacks
3. **Test thoroughly** — Verify the implementation works as expected
4. **Polish always** — The first implementation should feel finished

## When Encountering Issues

- If a fix feels like a workaround, step back and find the proper solution
- If the architecture doesn't support what's needed, fix the architecture
- If requirements are unclear, clarify before implementing
