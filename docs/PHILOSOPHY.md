# Tempo Philosophy

> **Time is the only folder.**

## The Core Insight

Modern productivity apps force an unnatural choice: heavy ecosystems that require constant maintenance, or simple lists that lack context. Tempo takes a different path — **temporal anchoring**.

Instead of organizing work into folders, projects, or databases, everything in Tempo lives at a point in time. Scroll up for history, down for the future. Your timeline is your workspace.

## Three Principles

### 1. Temporal Anchoring

Time is the primary organizational axis. Not folders, not tags, not complex hierarchies — just time.

- Every task anchors to a date
- Every note connects to when you wrote it
- Navigation is temporal: yesterday, today, tomorrow

This isn't a limitation — it's liberation. You stop worrying about *where* something goes and focus on *when* it matters.

### 2. Task-Note Singularity

A task shouldn't be a checkbox orphaned from context. In Tempo, every task can "bloom" into a full Markdown document.

- **Quick Tasks** for fast capture: "Buy milk"
- **Deep Tasks** for full context: meeting notes, project plans, research
- One-click promotion from quick to deep
- The task *is* the note — move one, move both

### 3. Visual Honesty

The interface tells you the truth about your capacity, not just your aspirations.

- Days show their load at a glance
- Overplanning is visible before it becomes overwhelm
- Completed work recedes; today's work shines
- Patterns emerge: when you actually complete tasks, when you struggle

## Design Values

### Calm Maximalism

Tempo is visually rich but mentally calm. We use:
- **Glassmorphic depth** — layers separate past, present, and future
- **Tactile interactions** — checkboxes have weight, completions feel satisfying
- **Ambient feedback** — subtle glows and transitions, not jarring alerts

### Local-First

Your data lives on your device. Sync is optional, not required. This means:
- Works offline, instantly
- Your notes are yours — plain Markdown, exportable anytime
- Privacy by default

### Opinionated, Not Infinite

Tempo solves one workflow brilliantly rather than everything poorly. We make choices so you don't have to configure endlessly.

## What Tempo Is Not

- **Not a second brain** — We're not competing with Obsidian or Notion. Tempo is for planning and doing, not building a knowledge graph.
- **Not a project manager** — No Gantt charts, no resource allocation, no team workflows.
- **Not another todo app** — We're not just a checkbox list. Every task has a time anchor and can grow into a document.

## Evolution Notes

### Calendar-First Pivot

The original vision emphasized an "Infinite Timeline" — vertical scrolling through all of time. In practice, we found that a **calendar-first** approach serves users better:

- The monthly calendar is the natural mental model for planning
- Day agenda views provide focus when you need it
- The timeline metaphor lives within navigation, not as the primary interface

This pivot keeps the temporal anchoring philosophy while improving usability.
