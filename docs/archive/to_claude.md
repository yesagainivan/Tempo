Hey! What do you think of this; I discussed an idea For a Agenda app with gemini, and they came to say:

I first ask the current landscape, 

```
Are there agenda apps that allow users to plan, have notes, and keep track of their work in a beautiful, customizable UI?
```

Searching for the perfect "all-in-one" productivity space can be a journey, especially since "beautiful" is subjective. In 2026, several apps have moved beyond simple lists to offer highly aesthetic, modular environments.

Here are the top agenda apps that balance planning, notes, and work tracking with exceptional UI and customization:

### 1. The Aesthetic Powerhouses (Modular & Customizable)

These apps act like a digital canvas where you build your own layout.

* **[Notion](https://www.notion.so):** Still the gold standard for customization. You can use "aesthetic" templates, custom icons, and cover photos to create a workspace that looks like a curated magazine or a minimalist dashboard.
* **[Anytype](https://anytype.io):** A privacy-focused, local-first alternative to Notion. It’s incredibly fast and uses a "block-based" system that looks very modern and sleek. It’s perfect if you want a beautiful UI without being tied to a cloud-only service.
* **[Xtiles](https://xtiles.app):** Often described as a mix of Notion and Miro. It uses a "card" and "tile" layout that is much more visual and less linear than traditional note apps, making it great for creative project planning.

### 2. The "Calendar-First" Planners

If your "agenda" revolves around your schedule and time-blocking, these are the most visually stunning options:

* **[Amie](https://amie.so):** Marketed as the "joyful productivity app." It integrates your calendar, tasks, and even Spotify activity into a very colorful, high-polish interface. It’s designed to feel like a social app rather than a boring work tool.
* **[Structured](https://structured.app):** Ideal if you love a visual timeline. It turns your to-do list into a beautiful, color-coded day plan. It’s simple, clean, and has a very high "aesthetic" rating among students and creative professionals.
* **[Routine](https://routine.co):** A high-end productivity app that combines a calendar, tasks, and a daily journal. Its UI is very minimalist and "pro," designed to help you focus without visual clutter.

### 3. Deep Work & Professional Focus

For those who need to track heavy workloads while maintaining a "clean" look.

* **[Sunsama](https://sunsama.com):** Focuses on "calm productivity." It’s a daily planner that pulls tasks from your email, Slack, and Trello into a single, beautiful view. It helps you plan your day intentionally rather than just reacting to a list.
* **[Akiflow](https://akiflow.com):** Similar to Sunsama but with a slightly more "tech-forward" and customizable feel. It’s a powerhouse for consolidating work from different platforms into one beautiful agenda.

### 4. Specialized & Unique UIs

* **[Agenda](https://agenda.com):** This is actually the name of an app that is "date-focused." It organizes your notes based on your calendar events. It’s elegant and perfect for people whose work is defined by meetings and deadlines.
* **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md):** While it starts as a plain text app, it is the **most** customizable on this list. With community themes (like "AnuPuccin" or "Minimal") and plugins, you can make it look exactly how you want.

I followed with:

```
Great display of the landscape! I want to build my own, minimal (not the entire notion ecosystem) but feature-rich Agenda app that draws the good pieces f all these paid options (except obsidian) and provide for users, Elegant planning! We should take ideas and approaches like "Agenda"'s note approach.

Can you craft a genesis idea for this app? The gist of what we want is; planning should feel efficient, visual feedback is important, Markdown notes for tasks are a must, we can expand with ideas from the found landscape!
```

Gemini replied:

```
This is a compelling vision. To build a "successor" to the current landscape, we need to bridge the gap between **static Markdown files** and **dynamic, time-aware planning**.

Let’s call this genesis project **"Tempo."** It’s designed to be a "high-resolution" agenda—minimalist in weight, but rich in tactile and visual feedback.

---

## The Genesis Idea: Tempo

**Tagline:** *Time is the only folder.*

### 1. The Core Philosophy: "Temporal Anchoring"

In most apps, notes live in folders and tasks live in lists. In **Tempo**, every piece of data is "Anchored" to a point in time.

* **The Infinite Timeline:** Instead of a sidebar of folders, you have a vertical "Chronicle." You scroll up for history and down for the future.
* **Agenda’s Note Approach 2.0:** Just like the app *Agenda*, you can "pin" any Markdown note to a calendar event. However, in Tempo, the note *is* the event. If you move the meeting, the note moves with it on your timeline.

### 2. The "Task-Note Singularity"

Instead of tasks being a simple line of text, **every task is a Markdown document.**

* **The "Expand" Interaction:** A task looks like a clean line. Click it, and it "blooms" (using a 2026 **Spatial UI** transition) into a full-width Markdown editor.
* **Markdown Tasks:** Within any note, `[ ]` syntax automatically creates a sub-task that mirrors onto your Daily Bento (see below). This keeps your "planning" and "doing" in the same file.

### 3. Visual Feedback & UI (2026 Aesthetic)

We draw from the "Calm UI" and "Tactile Maximalism" trends of 2026:

* **The Bento Dashboard:** Your "Today" view is a customizable Bento Grid. One tile shows your next meeting note, another shows your "Energy Level" (visualized as a glowing gradient), and another shows your top 3 Markdown tasks.
* **Tactile Progress:** Checking a task shouldn't just be a click. We use **"Squishy UI"** physics—the checkbox feels like it has resistance, and when completed, it emits a soft, haptic ripple and a color-fill that reflects the task’s category.
* **Glassmorphic Depth:** The timeline uses layers. Completed tasks "recede" into a blurred background layer (showing history), while today’s work sits on a crisp, elevated "Glass" pane.

### 4. Features for Efficient Planning

* **The Command Bar (`Ctrl + K`):** A lightning-fast input. Typing `/meeting 3pm Project X` creates a new Markdown note, links it to 3:00 PM, and applies your "Project X" template instantly.
* **Visual Load Indicators:** As you add tasks to a day, the date in the margin begins to "glow" or change weight. This provides immediate visual feedback if you are over-scheduling yourself.
* **Friction-Based Planning:** Every morning, Tempo presents a "Clear the Deck" screen. It forces you to drag yesterday's unfinished Markdown notes into today or back into the "Someday" vault. This is the "Intentionality" borrowed from Sunsama.

### Why this beats the "Paid Giants"

| Feature | Traditional Paid Apps | **Tempo** (Your App) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | Complex Folders/Databases | **Single Timeline (Date-Anchored)** |
| **Notes** | Often rich-text or basic | **Pure Markdown-native** |
| **Feel** | Static and "Work-like" | **Tactile & Fluid (2026 UI)** |
| **Ecosystem** | Heavy (Notion) or Disconnected | **Lean, integrated "Task-Notes"** |

### Next Step for the Build

To make this real, we should define the **"First 5 Minutes"** of user experience. This is where most apps fail or succeed.

**Would you like me to draft the "First Run" onboarding flow, or should we design the specific "Bento Grid" layout for the daily dashboard?**
